## Description
This project showcases a custom level design for the game Portal 2, demonstrating creativity and technical skills in game and level design.

The document details a well-structured level that requires players to solve puzzles using portals, manage laser emitters, and navigate through challenging environments.

The design emphasizes strategic thinking and problem-solving, highlighting my ability to create engaging and immersive gameplay experiences.

This project reflects my capacity for creative level design and my understanding of game mechanics, making it a valuable addition to my portfolio.
